[Click to find out how it works!](https://my-priv-blog.netlify.app)

This task involved creating a blog using the headless CMS (Prismic), allowing content creation without the need for a dedicated admin panel. Utilized Prismic's API to fetch blog content, with a focus on well-designed URLs for an optimal user experience. 
Implemented React Router DOM for efficient navigation, including categories, pagination and articles' names. 

### Solutions

In this project, I used:

- React Router: Employed React Router for seamless navigation, ensuring well-structured and user-friendly URLs.

- Pagination: Implemented a pagination system to organize content, displaying a limited number of blog posts per page for optimal user experience.

- Responsive Page Design: Ensured a responsive design to adapt seamlessly to various devices, providing an optimal viewing experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- Styled-Componentst: enhance the styling and design of the project, allowing for a modular and maintainable approach to styling React components. 

- ThemeProvider: implemented from Styled-Components to manage the global theme and styling variables across the entire application. This allowed for consistent theming, making it easier to maintain a cohesive design throughout various components.
